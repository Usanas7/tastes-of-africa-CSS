    <h2>A Brief History of African Cuisine</h2>
    <p>African cuisine is a reflection of the continent's vast diversity, shaped by geography, climate, and centuries of cultural exchange. From the coastal regions of North Africa to the savannas of Sub-Saharan Africa, each region boasts its own unique ingredients and cooking methods.</p>
    
    <p>Historically, African food has been influenced by both indigenous ingredients and external trade, including Arab, European, and Asian influences. The use of <mark>spices</mark>, <mark>herbs</mark>, and locally sourced ingredients like <mark>yams</mark>, <mark>cassava</mark>, <mark>maize</mark>, and <mark>plantains</mark> play a key role in African culinary traditions.</p>
    
    <p>Today, African cuisine is making a significant impact on the global food scene. Dishes like Jollof Rice, Tagine, and Injera have gained international recognition, and chefs from across the world are embracing African flavors. Through our website, we aim to contribute to this global appreciation of African culinary heritage and foster a deeper understanding of the continentâ€™s food culture.</p>
    
    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>We envision a future where African cuisine is widely celebrated, with its flavors and traditions recognized as integral parts of the global food community. By providing accessible recipes, cooking tips, and cultural insights, we aim to inspire both home cooks and professional chefs to explore the diverse and exciting world of African food.</p>
